# List-of-China-place-names
The original list are from the following sources:
1. https://books.google.com.tw/books?id=om8uAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=zh-TW#v=onepage&q&f=false
2. https://archive.org/details/mapofchinashan/mode/1up
3. https://books.google.com.tw/books?id=3X1OAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=zh-TW#v=onepage&q&f=false

so in the end there will be three folders to include all tables mentioned in these books seperately.

There will be a huge amount of work to do, hope I can finish them before the end of this year.
